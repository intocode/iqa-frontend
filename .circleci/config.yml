# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@4.1
  # The heroku orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize to deploy applications to heroku
  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/heroku
  # NOTE: Environment variables containing the necessary secrets can be setup in the CircleCI UI
  # See here https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project
  heroku: circleci/heroku@1.2

workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
  sample:
    jobs:
      - node/test
      - heroku/deploy-via-git:
          force: true # this parameter instructs the push to use a force flag when pushing to the heroku remote, see: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git
          requires:
            - node/test # only run deploy-via-git job if the build job has completed
